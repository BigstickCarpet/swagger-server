Swagger Server
============================

### ☠ This project is no longer supported or maintained ☠

I recommend using [swagger-express-middleware](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

Or, if you prefer a full-fledged server framework with an ORM, then swagger-express-middleware also supports [Sails](https://sailsjs.com/).


### If you want to continue using Swagger Server
The [original ReadMe](OLD_README.md), [code samples](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-server/tree/master/samples), and [walkthroughs](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-server/blob/master/samples/docs/running.md) are still available, and the package will remain on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-server)
